  description: 'Is the cat alive or dead? Somehow, the cat is both alive and dead
    at the same time.


    This is my first module and my first actual coding project. If you find any bugs
    in the module that I may have overlooked, contact me on Discord at RazorBlade#3550.


    I also want to thank GhostSalt and BakersDozenBagels for helping with this.


    This module also has TP support included.'
